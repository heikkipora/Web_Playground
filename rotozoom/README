Rotozoom is a JS/HTML5 implementation of the classic bitmap "rotozoom"-effect seen in oldskool demos.
Tested with Firefox v3.6+ only.

Needs to be loaded from a web server in order to run. Firefox thinks that file:// URLs are too dangerous for allowing image manipulation on files loaded from them :)

Note that this is an initial, non-performance-optimized, version. I'm planning to do some benchmarking regarding JS performance for "traditional low-level coder tricks"..
